			<h2>The origins</h2>
			<p>This history of Capoeira Angola is punctuated by historic moments and it is 
                difficult to give a summary that does justice to the survival of this art which 
                has gone through many pitfalls and overcome a long period of prohibition.
                Capoeira Angola was born among slaves in Brazil. Slave owners quickly recognized 
                the dangerous potential of this art. They therefore passed laws to prohibit the 
                practice (1890). Capoeira survives this period of prohibition thanks to the 
                imagination and resilience of slaves. It was in the early 1930s  that Capoeira 
                emerged and began to gain recognition among political elites, the era of 
                prohibition was coming to an end and Capoeira was slowly taking root among all 
                strata of Brazil. Several academies were created and Capoeira began to spread 
                throughout the world, the only martial art coming from the Americas. In 2014, 
                UNESCO added Capoeira to its representative list of the intangible cultural 
                heritage of humanity.
                Capoeira Angola is a real tool for awakening and social awareness.

			<h2>Mestre Pastinha </h2>
			<p>
				Vincente Ferreira Pastinha was born on April 5, 1889 and died on November 13, 1981. 
				As a child, he was small and frail, his neighbor, an old Angolan, Benedito, taught 
				him the basics of Capoeira. This is how he begins to practice and how he will later 
				want to share his knowledge. Among his many occupations, he became a sailor and 
				taught to his colleagues in the navy. When Mestre Bimba created the regional style, 
				Mestre Pastinha wanted to dedicate himself to the preservation of more traditional 
				capoeira, refusing to include techniques that come from other combat arts. It was at 
				this moment that the Capoeira he practiced became Capoeira Angola. And the Capoeira 
				Mestre Bimba, first named Luta Baiana Regional (Capoeira till being outlawed at that 
				time), became Capoeira Regional. Mestre Pastinha was also one of the first to write 
				a book on Capoeira and to develop an educational system for Capoeira Angola. He died 
				poor and practically  blind. He always advocated non-violence in the practice of 
				Capoeira Angola. His two greatest disciples are Mestre João Pequeno and Mestre João 
				Grande.
				Here is the description that the famous Brazilian writer Jorge Amado gives of Mestre 
				
				Pastinha: “I see myself leaning against the window of a house in Largo do Pelourinho 
				with next to me, an old man over seventy years old, with failing eyesight, small and 
				agile like a cat he is talking to me. We are old friends, I don’t even remember when 
				we met and since when I have been following his glorious trajectory. He is one of 
				the masters of Bahian popular culture, this black man with a soft voice and a happy 
				face, who is growing old within the walls of his Capoeira Angola school, dancing and
				 wrestling better than any of the young people with hard muscles of adolescents. I’m 
				 talking about Mestre Pastinha, one of the greatest capoeiristas Bahia has ever 
				 produced. He has just finished dancing a Samba de roda and is about to enter the 
				 Capoeira roda.” (Waldeloir Rego, op. cit., p. 274-275.)

			<h2>Mestre João Pequeno </h2>
			<p>After attending capoeira rodas, wanting to become more combative, Mestre João Pequeno
				 began practicing Capoeira with Mestre Gilvenson, he later became one of the main 
				 disciples of Mestre Pastinha, it was he who influenced the famous Mestre João Grade
				  to practice of Capoeira. In 1970, Mestre Pastinha said about Mestre João Pequeno: 
				  “He will be the greatest Capoeira player of the future.”
				He was born on December 27, 1917 and taught Capeira Angola until his death on
				 December 9, 2011. He experienced the time when Capoeira was banned, he traveled a
				 round the world to teach his heart. It is Colette’s encounter with Mestre João 
				 Pequeno in Boston (1992), that brings her to Salvador, where she met Mestre Jogo 
				 de Dentro (1994). Mestre João Pequeno is unavoidable in Capoeira Angola modern 
				 history.

		<div class="section4">
			<h2>Mestre Jogo de Dentro </h2>
			<p>Mestre Jogo de Dentro trained to become a master of Capoeira Angola at the Centre 
				Esportiva de Capoeira Angola of the legendary Mestre João Pequeno, himself a 
				disciple of another legendary figure of this art, Mestre Pastinha. In 1991, he 
				founded the Grupo de Capoeira Semente do Jogo de Angola (GCSJA), in Salvador de 
				Bahia. Today, the Grupo is established in several cities in Brazil, and also in 
				Canada, France, Italy, Israel, Japan, Colombia, Costa Rica, New Zealand. Mestre 
				Jogo de Dentro is the author of two books and six CDs (see Mercado Modelo).

			<h2>Grupo de Capoeira  Semente do Jogo de Angola in Montréal</h2>
			<p>
			    The Grupo has been established since 1994, thanks to the efforts of a handful of 
				enthusiasts. It was born from the meeting of Mestre Jogo de Dentro and Colette in 
				December 1994. We celebrate 30 years of existence next December. First established 
				at 10, rue des Pins west, it has been located since 1998 at 372, Sainte-Catherine 
				west, studio 310. Training takes place 4 times a week.

			<h2>Mestre Colette </h2>
			<p>A pioneer of Capoeira Angola in Canada, she has been practicing since 1990, at 
				which time contemporary Capoeira was booming. In 1993, Colette undertook her first 
				trip to Brazil and in 1994 during her second stay, she met in Salvador de Bahia, the
				 man who became her mentor, Mestre Jogo de Dentro. Their alliance gave rise to 
				 countless trips by the Mestre to Montreal, and by Colette to Brazil. She established
				  and directed the Grupo de Capoeira Semente do Jogo de Angola, in Montreal, and also 
				taught at UQAM, McGill University, and at the YMCA for many years.

			<h2>Contramestre Nicolas</h2>
			<p>Nicolas began practicing Capoeira Angola with Colette in January 2000. He quickly 
				became her right-hand man. Talented both in combat dance and Afro-Brazilian music 
				and rhythms, he as the gift of sowing around him an atmosphere of conviviality and 
				trust. Colette quickly handed over the reins to him when she was absent. In 2019, 
				he moved to Quebec and set up a cell of the Grupo de Capoeira Semente do Jogo de 
				Angola. In 2021, he became the first contramestre formed by Colette and the GCSJA 
				cell in Montreal.
